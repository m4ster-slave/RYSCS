# RYSCS

**RPGYUMYUMS SUPER COOL SHELL**

- RYSCS is a simple shell with basic features might add some cool stuff we will see how much fun I have working on this.


## TODO
- [ ] fix Whitespace seperating args + ""
- [ ] piping 
- [ ] other standart builtins of bash 
- [ ] clear with ctrl + l --> "tput -x clear" 
- [ ] history
- [ ] A good autocomplete implementation like in fish

## How to run
To run the shell right now, 
    - clone the repo
    - run ```make```
    - run ```./RYSCS```

## builtins
- cd (changes the cwd of the process(the shell))
- help (prints basic info about the shell)
- exit (exits out of the shell into where you started it from)
